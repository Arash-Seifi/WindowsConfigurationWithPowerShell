# Windows Configuration with PowerShell

This repository serves as a reference for scripts and guides I have written to help automate common Windows configuration tasks using PowerShell. Each task is accompanied by a `.ps1` file for easy execution.

## Available Automation Scripts

The following tasks are automated using the provided scripts:

### 1. Disabling Firewall for Private and Public Profiles
Easily turn off the firewall for both private and public network profiles with a simple PowerShell command.

### 2. Creating a Network Teamed Interface
Automate the creation of a network team (NIC Teaming) for improved redundancy and increased bandwidth in multi-interface environments.

### 3. Renaming Network Interfaces
Quickly rename network interfaces using PowerShell, making it easier to manage and identify your network devices.

### 3. Automating User Account Creation and Auto-Login Configuration
This PowerShell script creates a local user account, ensures the password never expires, and optionally configures auto-login based on user input.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired script file in the repository.
3. Run the script in PowerShell with administrator privileges.

Each `.ps1` file is self-contained and ready to use. Make sure to review the script before running it to ensure it meets your specific needs.
